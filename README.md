# Project Showcase
Welcome! These are a few examples of projects that I have created while learning C#, ASP.NET and full-stack development. Let me tell you a bit about what each one is about!

## Student Admissions
#### *Full-stack .NET Project*
Created a ASP.NET MVC project for a student admissions website using **C#, Razor, and Entity Framework** to perform a variety of CRUD services on a local database running in **Docker**. The admissions site adds new students and provides access to their profile features and class enrollment.

## Cafe Point of Sale
#### *3-Tier Console App*
Designed a **3-tier C# application** with a console interface that performed cafe order workflow tasks, showed time-based menu options, and had basic sales reporting. Also, created a training mode implementation that swapped in Lists in place of DB tables and allowed a new user to learn the system without affecting the database.

## Library Management
#### *N-Tier Console App w/ multiple data access options*
Using a local database running in Docker, I created a large console app that allows borrowers to checkout media from a library. It validates if their account is in good standing and allows/denies future borrowing based on that info. This project could also swap ORMs (**Entity Framework** or **Dapper**) or use **ADO.NET**.
