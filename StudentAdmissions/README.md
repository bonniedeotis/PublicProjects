# Student Admissions Web App
## Full-stack ASP.NET w/ Razor Pages
### Features:
* ASP.NET MVC
* Entity Framework backend
* Web app for a super-villan student academy:
  * Enroll a new student in the academy
  * Sign up for classes
  * Add/edit/delete special powers and weaknesses
  * View lists of available courses
  * Reports of students with specific powers or weaknesses
* Frontend uses a mix of Razor, HTML and Bootstrap

### Challenges:
* ***Working with Razor Pages***
  * This was my first full stack project working with Razor. It was interesting learning how and when to work in C# code via Razor mixed in with the HTML and Bootstrap
* ***Creating a student profile page that gave access to their enrolled classes, strengths, weaknesses, and the ability to edit/update basic info.***
  * To solve this and create a clean and user-friendly experience I added in tabbed content so that the user could toggle between tables of the classes, strengths, or weaknesses based on what they wanted to see or access.
